## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

The user can view the landing page of the website. The page contains a header and main. The header has a button on the far left that the user can click in order to display a Navbar that is collapsable by pressing the button again. Once the Navbar is being displayed, the user can filter through the beers using 3 filters. The first filter is a slider that will display all the beers that have an ABV that is greater than a certain value based on the slider. The second filter is a button that will display all the beers that were brewed before 2010. The last filter is a button that will display all the beers that are below the pH of 4. Below the Navbar, the user can find a search bar where they can search for a beer by name. The user can only search for beers based on the filters, if any, they have chosen.
